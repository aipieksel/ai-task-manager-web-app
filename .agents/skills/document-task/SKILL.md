# Document Task Skill

Complete documentation, task logs, observations, lessons, and closeout materials. Do not mark completed until user verification passed and R2 closeout approved.

Before documentation work, read the plan's `Relevant Lessons`, read `docs/tasks/lessons-active.md`, match `docs/tasks/lessons-index.json` by task keywords, confirmed documentation paths, and docs workflow type, and read `docs/tasks/lessons.md` only for matched IDs needing more context. State `Applied lessons` before editing documentation; if nothing matches, state `Applied lessons: none.` Re-run the lookup if documentation scope or touched paths change.
## High-Visibility Blocked Response Contract

When execution, reviewer handoff, independent review, verification, commit attempt, documentation handoff, lifecycle movement, or required tooling is blocked, the agent's next chat response MUST begin with this exact high-visibility Markdown format as the first visible content:

```markdown
# 🚨 BLOCKED — ACTION REQUIRED

**Blocked stage:** <execution | reviewer handoff | independent review | verification | commit | documentation handoff | lifecycle movement | tooling>
**Plan:** <plan id/title/path>
**Blocking issue:** <one sentence, concrete blocker>
**What I tried:** <1-3 bullets or one sentence>
**What is not verified/complete:** <specific remaining risk>
**Required user/agent action:** <exact next action needed>
**Work status:** <stopped | safe partial progress saved | returned for correction>

## Details
<brief supporting details, links, evidence paths, or logs>
```

Rules:
- The `# 🚨 BLOCKED — ACTION REQUIRED` heading MUST be the first visible line of the response. Do not put greetings, summaries, Applied lessons, status prose, or citations before it.
- Use this format for any blocker that prevents safe progress, review delegation, R1/R2 approval, verification completion, lifecycle movement, or user-verification handoff.
- If multiple blockers exist, list the most blocking issue first and put the rest under `## Details`.
- Do not bury blocked status at the end of a normal progress update.
- Do not use softer headings such as `Note`, `Important`, `Issue`, or `Partial` for true blockers.
- Record the same blocker in the appropriate plan file (`06-executor-report.md`, `08-verification-handoff.md`, `09-r1-review.md`, `10-post-implementation-checklist.md`, `11-r2-closeout-review.md`, or `12-comments.md`) after emitting the blocked chat response.
